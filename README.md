# Employee-Performance-Classification

Employee performance increases the organization's efficiency and production. Hence, measuring employee performance and providing employee performance ratings is important for today's businesses. This project aimed to classify employees according to the 28 features in the dataset which would affect their performance. Firstly, data were preprocessed using Feature Selection, Feature Scaling, and train-test data split techniques to make data consistent, efficient, and ready for further processing. Classification of employees in our dataset was done using Artificial Neural Network (Accuracy - 87.07%), Decision Tree (Accuracy - 92.5%), Random Forest (Accuracy - 95.833%), and XGBoost Classifier (Accuracy - 95.833%). Finally, to increase the accuracy of our prediction the ensemble learning approach was implemented using a soft voting classifier by integrating the results of the above four algorithms into one hybrid model giving an accuracy of 96.25%.
